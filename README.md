# Diffusion Model with Eurosat Dataset 🛰️
This repo is a modified version of the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sjy9odlSSy0RBVgMTgP7s99NXsqglsUL?usp=sharing) from [@deepfindr](https://github.com/deepfindr), explained in his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Yfz2FxXiY&list=PLs0Tb3hSGtOeh2Ij4k-8UHzriW1DZBeHh).

## Main Changes ✨
- Switched the original Stanford Cars dataset with the Eurosat dataset, which is a cool collection of satellite images 🌍.
- Added a checkpoint saving feature, so no worries about losing progress during training 💾.
- Since I'm learning the basics of diffusion models, I've added a bunch of comments in the code and markdown cells 📝.

The best model generated during training can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/alvarofg21/eurosat_diffusionmodel). You can also check out some generated images in the `images/` folder

You can have a quick look at the results* in the image above.

Also, i leave here some references that may be useful if you are also learning about diffusion models.
